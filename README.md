[![](https://travis-ci.org/AdguardTeam/AdGuardSDNSFilter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AdguardTeam/AdGuardSDNSFilter)

A filter composed of several other filters (English filter, Social media filter, Spyware filter, Mobile Ads filter, EasyList and EasyPrivacy) and simplified specifically to be better compatible with DNS-level ad blocking.

This is a default filter for [AdGuard DNS](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardDNS).
